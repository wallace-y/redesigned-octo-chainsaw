# Planning
- [x] Outline the functionality
- [x] Sketch the UI
- [x] Break up the UI of the app into components
- [x] Name the components
- [x] Decide on what data the application will hold in state
- [x] For each piece of state determine which components will need access to that state - either to read or update it

# Setup
- [x] Create your app directory (e.g. with create-react-app)
- [x] Run your app
- [x] Create a static render of blank components as per your hierarchy
- [] Check everything is hooked up and the component tree is rendered

# Build components
- [] Work on each component in turn. Generally starting high up the tree and working your way down works well.
- [] Add the required state to your components and render that state correctly. (You can change the initial state manually to check it renders the way you want for now)
- [] Once the state is rendered correctly add any functionality that will set that state.
- [] Repeat this for all the functionality of a component before moving on to the next.
- [] Once all the functionality of a component is complete you can style the component at this point or leave all your styling until the end.
- [] Repeat this process until you have a complete app.
